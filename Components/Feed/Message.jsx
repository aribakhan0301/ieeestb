            I am glad to pen for the IEEE Student Branch of Zakir Hussain College of Engineering and Technology, AMU. IEEE is the worldâ€™s largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The student branch in collaboration with other affinity groups, has been organizing several tech conferences, competitions, workshops, and seminars. The newsletter highlights the various events, awards, and recognitions that took place, thus making it a rewarding experience for the readers.
          </p>

            I congratulate the chairs, office bearers, and volunteers who have given their utmost dedication, time, and expertise in maintaining one of the most vibrant and outshining clubs at AMU.
